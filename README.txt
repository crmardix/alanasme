Alana and S-Merelda

This began as a collaborative effort between a programmer and an artist to build a simple game using HTML5 Canvas. It was initially intended to be an entry into an HTML5 game development contest, but was not yet ready by the deadline.

To run the game, simply load the index.html file into a browser which supports HTML5 Canvas.

KNOWN ISSUES:

- Purchasing upgrades at the Shop is broken
- Ram Runner spazzes out on destruction and doesn't actually destruct
- Game hangs upon player defeat

TODO:

- Finish implementing player upgrades
- Improve UI graphics
- Set up proper screen resizing to fit container
- Implement boss enemy
- Separate data JSON from program JS
